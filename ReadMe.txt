EasyEncode is a set of free, open source command-line utilities for detecting and converting file encodings among common formats, operating under Windows.  Each utility operates as a stand-alone executable in console mode, without a graphical user interface (GUI).  Four encodings are supported, accounting for most encodings in use today:  UTF-16, UTF-8 with a byte order mark (BOM), UTF-8 without a BOM, and ANSI.  

Character encodings are a complex subject.  EasyEncode does not eliminate a developer's need for knowledge in this area, but once encodings are understood conceptually, the software eases work with them.  The utilities may be used either manually at the command line, or programmatically by applications that call them as needed.

Full documentation is in the file EasyEncode.htm.
